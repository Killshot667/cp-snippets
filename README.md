# cp-snippets

Here I have collated my implementations of most of the prominent data structures and algorithms I use for competitive programming. Note that these are catered to my specific tastes, but feel free to propose changes and additions. I will happy to incorporate them! They are classified based on the type of algo/ds as given below : 

- **advance-ds.cpp** - not-so-basic stuff which finds dynamic use in a wide range of questions like Fenwick tree, Sparse Matrix, Segment Tree (with lazy propagation), etc.
- **array.cpp** - functions for permutations and inversion calculations.
- **bitmasks.cpp** - guidelines and tricks for bitmask calculations. very useful for quick reference.
- **geometry.cpp** - function for orientation between two general lines, and Graham Scan for convex hull.
- **maths.cpp** - functions for binary exponentiation, GCD calculation, modulus operations, combinatorics calculations (such as using classical method, Luca's theorem etc), Sieve of Eratosthenes, mobius inversion and many more.
- **string.cpp** - string functions like KMP, Z-function, Rabin-Karp hashing and Manacher.
